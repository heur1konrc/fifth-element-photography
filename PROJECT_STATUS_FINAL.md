# Fifth Element Photography - Order Form Project Status

**Last Updated:** October 22, 2025

## üéâ Major Victory: Order Form is LIVE!

After a 15+ hour battle with Railway's Python module caching, the order form is now fully operational with a clean wizard interface.

## Working URLs

**Wizard Order Form (Recommended):**

```

**Legacy Full List Form:**

## What's Working

### 1. Product Database
- **1,420 total products** imported from Lumaprints API
- All products active and available
- Organized by 8 product types
- Prices calculated with 50% markup (temporary for testing)

### 2. Wizard Interface
The wizard provides a clean, step-by-step ordering experience:

**Step 1: Choose Product Type** (8 options as cards)
- Canvas Prints (71 options)
- Framed Canvas Prints (102 options)
- Fine Art Paper Prints (189 options)
- Framed Fine Art Paper Prints (8 filtered combinations)
- Foam-Mounted Fine Art Paper Prints (189 options)
- Metal Prints (28 options)
- Peel and Stick Prints (26 options)
- Rolled Canvas Prints (25 options)

**Step 2: Choose Options** (cards)
- For Canvas: Frame depth options (0.75", 1.25", 1.5", Rolled)
- For Framed Canvas: Depth + Color combinations
- For Framed Fine Art: Paper + Mat + Color combinations (filtered to 8)
- For Fine Art: Paper type options

**Step 3: Choose Size** (dropdown)
- All available sizes for selected product
- Format: "12√ó16 - $35.99"
- Compact and scannable

**Step 4: Review & Add to Cart**
- Shows complete selection
- Displays final price
- Add to Cart button

### 3. Product Filtering
To keep the interface manageable, Framed Fine Art Paper Prints are filtered to show only:

**Paper Types:**
- Hot Press
- Cold Press
- Semi-Glossy
- Semi-Matte

**Mat Sizes:**
- No Mat only

**Frame Colors:**
- Black
- White

This reduces 790 combinations down to just **8 manageable options**.

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Next button appears on same line as step title (right-aligned)
- Always visible without scrolling
- Product types in logical order
- Clean, professional interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Progress indicator shows current step

### 5. Image Detection
- Automatically detects image dimensions
- Calculates aspect ratio
- Estimates DPI
- Displays image preview throughout wizard

## Technical Implementation

### The Caching Solution
Railway was caching old Python modules with incorrect database schema. The solution was to create completely NEW routes and function names that Railway had never seen:

**New Routes:**
- `/print-order` - Full list form
- `/print-order-wizard` - Wizard interface
- `/api/print-order/products` - Product API

**New Files:**
- `print_order_api.py` - Fresh API with new function names
- `templates/print_order_wizard.html` - Wizard interface
- `templates/print_order_form.html` - Full list form

### Database Schema
Products are stored with all necessary data for Lumaprints orders:

```python
{
    "id": 358,
    "name": "Framed Canvas Print - 0.75\" Frame - Black - 11x14",
    "product_type": "Framed Canvas Prints",
    "category": "Canvas - 1.25\" Stretched",
    "size": "11x14",
    "cost_price": 65.99,
    "retail_price": 67.31,  # Calculated: cost_price √ó 1.5
    "lumaprints_options": "[1, 16]",  # Option IDs for Lumaprints API
    "lumaprints_subcategory_id": 102001,
    "active": 1
}
```

### Order Data Structure
When customer adds to cart, the form collects:

```javascript
{
    print_sku: "101001",           // Product SKU
    print_url: "https://...",      // High-res image URL
    print_width: 12,               // Width in inches
    print_height: 12,              // Height in inches
    lumaprints_options: "1,16"     // Comma-separated option IDs
}
```

## Next Priorities

### 1. Pricing Tool Integration (Priority 2)
Connect wizard to pricing tool at https://fifthelement.photos/admin/pricing

**Requirements:**
- Read retail prices from pricing tool database
- Allow global markup adjustment via admin interface
- Allow individual product price overrides
- Update button recalculates all prices globally

### 2. Shopping Cart Persistence
- Save cart items to session or database
- Allow quantity adjustments
- Show cart total
- Remove items functionality

### 3. Checkout Flow
- Collect customer information
- Payment processing (PayPal integration exists)
- Order submission to OrderDesk
- Email confirmation

### 4. Multi-Step Wizard Enhancement (Future)
For a more refined experience, implement dynamic step counts:

**Framed Fine Art (5 steps instead of 4):**
1. Product Type
2. Paper Type (cards)
3. Mat Size (cards)
4. Frame Color (cards)
5. Size (dropdown)

This requires significant restructuring but provides better UX.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Pricing:** Using 50% markup for testing; needs pricing tool integration
2. **Product Filtering:** Framed Fine Art limited to 8 combinations; will expand after multi-step wizard
3. **Cart:** No persistence yet; items lost on page refresh
4. **Checkout:** Not yet implemented

### Technical Debt
1. Two Next buttons exist (one at top of step, one at bottom) - bottom one should be hidden
2. Parser functions extract data from product names; should use structured data
3. Step indicator fixed at 4 steps; should be dynamic based on product type
