2. Re-enabled Lumaprints integration
3. Fixed `avg_customer_price` calculation in pricing_admin.py
4. Deployed to Railway

## Results
✅ Lumaprints pricing tool fully functional
✅ 1660 products loaded
✅ 7 categories available
✅ 50% global markup working
✅ Avg cost and customer price calculations working

## Known Minor Issues
- Individual category expand/collapse not working (Expand All works fine)
