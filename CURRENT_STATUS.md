# Current Status - Print Ordering System

## Completed
1. ✅ Database initialization working on Railway
2. ✅ 156 products loaded successfully
3. ✅ Aspect ratios fixed (1:1 and 3:2 only)
4. ✅ Accordion-style browse page created
5. ✅ Admin login temporarily disabled for testing

## Issues Discovered
1. ❌ Framed Canvas pricing doesn't account for frame color variations
   - Different frame colors (Black, White, Oak, Gold, Walnut) have different prices
   - Current database structure treats all frame colors as same price
   - Need to add frame color as a product attribute with separate pricing

2. ❌ Browse page accordion concept needs refinement
   - User reviewing the layout and functionality

## Waiting For
- User feedback on accordion layout
- User direction on how to handle frame color pricing variations

## Next Steps (Pending User Input)
- Address frame color pricing structure
- Refine browse page based on feedback
- Re-enable admin login after testing complete
