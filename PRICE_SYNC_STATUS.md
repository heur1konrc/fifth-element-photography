# Pictorem Price Sync - Implementation Complete

## Status: ✅ WORKING

### What Was Fixed

1. **Created `sync_single_product.py`**
   - Syncs prices for one product at a time
   - Better error handling and detailed logging
   - Avoids 90-second timeout issues

2. **Added Individual Sync Buttons**
   - Each product section on `/admin/catalog` has a "Sync Prices" button
   - Shows real-time status: "Ready to sync" → "Syncing..." → "✓ Synced X/Y sizes"
   - Auto-reloads page after successful sync

3. **Fixed Price Display**
   - Updated `get_product_sizes()` to JOIN with `pictorem_product_pricing` table
   - Prices now display correctly after sync
   - Shows both base price and customer price with markup

### How to Use

1. Visit https://fifthelement.photos/admin/catalog
2. Click "Sync Prices" on any product section
3. Wait 5-10 seconds for sync to complete
4. Page reloads automatically showing updated prices
5. Repeat for each product

### Database Structure

**Pricing Table: `pictorem_product_pricing`**
- `product_id` - Links to pictorem_products
- `size_id` - Links to pictorem_sizes
- `option_id` - For framed products with options (NULL for simple products)
- `preorder_code` - Pictorem API code
- `base_price` - Cost from Pictorem
- `markup_percentage` - Current markup (50%)
- `customer_price` - Final price shown to customers
- `last_synced` - Timestamp of last sync

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/sync_product/<product_slug>` - Sync single product
- `GET /api/product/<slug>/sizes` - Get sizes with pricing
- `GET /api/products/catalog` - Get all products

### Product Slugs

- `stretched-canvas-075` ✅ SYNCED
- `stretched-canvas-15`
- `framed-fine-art-print`
- `metal-hd-chromaluxe`
- `metal-brushed-aluminum`
- `acrylic-print-18`
- `fine-art-paper-print`

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Sync remaining 6 products
2. Update `/print-order` route to use Pictorem database
3. Test complete order flow
4. Implement order submission to Pictorem API
