# Fulfillment API Investigation Status

**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025  
**Critical Issue:** NO PRICING API FROM LUMAPRINTS

---

## Current Blocker

The complete dynamic order form system is built and functional with 913 Lumaprints product options mapped in the database. However, **Lumaprints provides NO API access for automated pricing**, making it impossible to launch without manual price maintenance for nearly 1,000 product combinations.

---

## Database Information

**Location:** `/home/ubuntu/fifth-element-photography/database.db`  
**Type:** SQLite 3  
**Content:** Complete Lumaprints catalog
- 7 categories
- 44 subcategories  
- 913 product option combinations

**Schema:**
- `products` table with lumaprints_subcategory_id, lumaprints_frame_option, sub_option_1_id, sub_option_2_id
- Hierarchical structure supporting 2-10 selection boxes in dynamic form

---

## Why We're Close to Dumping Lumaprints

1. **NO API ACCESS** - Zero API endpoints for pricing, product data, or automation
2. **Waiting on Dev Team** - Contacted Lumaprints requesting API; dev team investigating with no timeline
3. **913 Product Combinations** - Manual pricing maintenance is completely impractical
4. **System Ready to Launch** - Everything else is built and working, blocked only on pricing

## Alternative Fulfillment Partners Investigated

### Printify (Investigated Oct 23, 2025)

**API Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT
- Direct integration without Shopify confirmed
- Personal Access Token authentication  
- Full REST API with automated pricing
- Catalog endpoints: `GET /v1/catalog/blueprints/{id}/print_providers/{id}/variants.json`
- Rate limits: 600 req/min global, 100 req/min catalog
- Order management, webhooks, product creation all supported

**Product Quality:** ❌ INSUFFICIENT

**Canvas:**
- 8+ options, $10.87-$22.21 range
- Multiple depths (0.75", 1.25", 1.5", 1.6")
- 14-60 sizes per type
- Basic POD quality, not gallery-grade

**Framed Products:** CRITICAL GAP
- Only basic framed posters
- 3 frame colors (black, white, natural)
- NO mat options
- NO glazing options  
- NO frame style variety
- 7 sizes maximum

**Metal Prints:** NOT PHOTOGRAPHY GRADE
- "Metal Art Sign" is decorative signage
- Not dye-sublimation aluminum prints
- Not suitable for fine art photography

**Fine Art Paper:**
- Available unframed ($7.91+)
- Cannot combine with professional framing
- Either paper OR framing, not both

**Verdict:** Printify = Etsy/POD market, NOT professional photography

### Fotomoto (Earlier Investigation)

**Result:** REJECTED  
- Complete turnkey solution
- Pricing too high ($159 for 8x12 canvas)
- Not competitive

### Shopify Integration

**Result:** IMPRACTICAL
- Requires manual mapping of all combinations
- 913 options = not feasible

---

## The Core Problem

**Need:** Professional photography products + Deep customization + Automated pricing API

**Have:**
- ✅ Sophisticated dynamic order form (working)
- ✅ Complete Lumaprints database (913 options)
- ❌ NO pricing API from Lumaprints
- ❌ Printify has API but wrong products

**Gap:** Need BOTH professional products AND automated pricing. Lumaprints has products but no API. Printify has API but basic products.

---

## Options Moving Forward

### Option 1: Wait for Lumaprints API
- Follow up with dev team
- Risk: No timeline guaranteed
- Benefit: Best product quality

### Option 2: Research Other Professional Labs
Investigate:
- Bay Photo (professional metal prints)
- WHCC (wholesale photo lab)
- Miller's Professional Imaging
- Prodigi (higher-end POD)

### Option 3: Hybrid Launch
Launch with 3-5 signature products, manual pricing:
- Gallery Wrapped Canvas (3 sizes)
- Framed Fine Art Print (1 frame, 3 sizes)  
- Metal Print (3 sizes)

Start selling immediately, activate full system when API available.

### Option 4: Manual Pricing Admin Tool
Build admin interface for manual price updates. Labor-intensive but maintains quality while waiting.

## Next Decision Required

Choose path forward:
1. Lumaprints (wait for API)
2. Alternative lab (research)
3. Hybrid launch (limited products)
4. Manual pricing tool (admin interface)

System is 100% ready to launch pending pricing solution.
