## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure

The V3 form queries the **rebuilt Lumaprints database** with this structure:

### product_types table
```
id | name                      | display_order
1  | Canvas                    | 1
2  | Framed Canvas             | 2
3  | Fine Art Paper            | 3
4  | Framed Fine Art Paper     | 4
5  | Metal Prints              | 5
6  | Peel & Stick              | 6
7  | Foam-Mounted Fine Art     | 7
```

### categories table
```
id | name                           | product_type_id | display_order
1  | Rolled Canvas                  | 1               | 1
2  | 0.75" Stretched Canvas         | 1               | 2
3  | 1.25" Stretched Canvas         | 1               | 3
...
```

### products table
```
id | name | product_type_id | category_id | size | cost_price | retail_price |
   lumaprints_subcategory_id | lumaprints_options | active
```

**Key Fields:**
- `lumaprints_subcategory_id`: Maps to Lumaprints API product code (e.g., 101001)
- `lumaprints_options`: JSON string with option IDs (e.g., "12,27" for Black frame, Archival Matte paper)
- `size`: Print size in format "12x16" (width x height in inches)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Import on Production
Visit: `https://fifth-element-photography-production.up.railway.app/admin/import-interface`
- Click "Run Import" to populate 10,350 products
- Verify product counts match expected numbers

### 2. Test Order Form
Visit: `https://fifth-element-photography-production.up.railway.app/order?image=https://fifthelement.photos/images/starling.JPG`
- Verify image loads and metadata displays
- Check that compatible products are shown
- Test add to cart and checkout flow

### 3. Integrate Payment Gateway
- Add Stripe or PayPal checkout
- Connect payment success to order submission
- Test end-to-end with real payment

### 4. Link from Gallery
Update gallery modal to include "Order Prints" button that opens:
```
/order?image=https://fifthelement.photos/images/[image_filename]
```

## üîß Maintenance

### Updating Product Pricing
1. Update pricing JSON files in repository
2. Run import script: `python3 import_all_lumaprints_products.py`
3. Or use admin interface: `/admin/import-interface`

### Adding New Product Types
1. Add to `product_types` table with display_order
2. Add categories to `categories` table
3. Add products with correct Lumaprints codes
4. Import will automatically include in order form

### Troubleshooting

**Products not showing:**
- Check database has products: `/admin/import-status`
- Verify image metadata is being extracted
- Check browser console for API errors

**OrderDesk integration failing:**
- Verify API credentials in `orderdesk_integration.py`
- Check Railway logs for error messages
- Test API endpoint manually with curl/Postman

**Images not loading:**
- Ensure full URL is passed (not relative path)
- Check CORS settings if images are on different domain
- Verify image URL is accessible publicly
