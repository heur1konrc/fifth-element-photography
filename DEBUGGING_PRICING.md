# Debugging Pricing Display Issue

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed Issues:**
1. Disabled broken image quality check (was hanging the form)
2. Fixed field name: `subcategoryId` (not `id`)
3. API calls are being made (24 requests visible in Network tab)
4. All API calls return 200 OK

❌ **Current Problem:**
Prices not displaying on size buttons

## Root Cause

API returns: `{"error": "Product not found for subcategory 105003 and size 6x4", "success": false}`

## Possible Issues

1. **Wrong subcategory ID**: Maybe 105003 isn't in the database
2. **Wrong size format**: Maybe database has "6×4" or "6\" x 4\"" instead of "6x4"
3. **Database mismatch**: Maybe the pricing database doesn't match Lumaprints subcategory IDs

## Next Steps

1. Check `/admin/database/check-products` endpoint to see:
   - What subcategory IDs exist in database
   - What size formats are used
   - Sample products for subcategory 105003

2. Fix the mismatch between:
   - Lumaprints API subcategory IDs (105003)
   - Database subcategory IDs (unknown)
   - Size formats from Lumaprints vs database
