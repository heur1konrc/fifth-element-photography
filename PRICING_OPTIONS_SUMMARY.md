# Pricing Options Summary

## Problem
Lumaprints API does NOT provide a pre-order pricing endpoint. Pricing is only available AFTER submitting an order.

## Discovery
- ❌ `/api/v1/pricing` endpoint does not exist
- ✅ `/api/v1/pricing/shipping` only returns shipping costs
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/orders/{orderNumber}` returns pricing AFTER order submission
- ✅ Order response includes: `itemCostTotal`, `subTotal`, `shippingTotal`, `taxTotal`, `orderTotal`

## Solutions Discussed

### Option 1: Web Scraping
- Automate visits to Lumaprints website
- Capture prices for all combinations
- Pros: Complete data
- Cons: Fragile, slow, may violate TOS

### Option 2: Manual Price List Import
- Request wholesale price list from Lumaprints
- Import CSV/Excel into database
- Pros: Official, reliable
- Cons: Manual updates required

### Option 3: Base Price + Option Upcharges ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- Store base price per product/size
- Store upcharge per option
- Calculate: base_price + sum(option_upcharges)
- Pros: Small database, easy maintenance, flexible
- Cons: Need to determine pricing structure

### Option 4: Simplified Pricing
- Only store popular configurations
- "Contact for quote" for others
- Pros: Very simple
- Cons: Limited customer options

## Order Management Decision

### OrderDesk (Recommended)
- Handles order routing, tracking, webhooks
- Multi-provider support
- Less code to maintain
- Additional cost but worth it

### Direct Lumaprints Integration
- More control, no middleman
- More code to write and maintain
- Locked into single provider

## Current Status
- ✅ Product catalog complete (7 categories, 44 subcategories, 168 option groups)
- ✅ Dynamic form working perfectly
- ❌ Pricing integration blocked (no API endpoint)
- ⏳ Awaiting decision on pricing strategy

## Next Steps
1. Decide on pricing strategy (Option 3 recommended)
2. Determine how to obtain base prices and upcharges
3. Build pricing calculation system
4. Integrate with OrderDesk for order submission
