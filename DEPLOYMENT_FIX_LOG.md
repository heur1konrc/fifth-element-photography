# Deployment Fix Log

## Issue 1: Application Failed to Respond
**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Error**: IndentationError in routes/setup_pricing.py at line 203

### Root Cause
When simplifying the setup route to use a pre-populated database template instead of Excel import, the old Excel import code was left in a comment block with broken indentation. Python's parser couldn't handle the malformed multi-line string comment.

### Error Message
```
File "/app/routes/setup_pricing.py", line 203
    INSERT INTO base_pricing 
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

### Fix Applied
**Commit**: 1d53107 - "Fix IndentationError in setup_pricing.py - remove broken commented code"

Completely removed the old commented Excel import code (276 lines) and kept only the clean, working version that copies the pre-populated database template (108 lines).

### Files Changed
- `routes/setup_pricing.py`: Rewritten to remove broken commented code

### Verification
- File imports successfully: `python3.11 -c "from routes.setup_pricing import setup_pricing_bp"`
- No syntax errors
- Database template verified: `database_templates/print_ordering_initial.db` (168KB, SQLite 3.x)

## Current Status
**Commit**: 1d53107
**Status**: Deploying to Railway
**Expected Result**: Site should come back online with working setup page

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. Access `/admin/setup-pricing`
2. Click "Initialize Database" button
3. Verify 156 products are initialized
4. Access `/admin/pricing` to view pricing dashboard
5. Test all admin interface features

## Lessons Learned
- Always remove or properly format commented code blocks
- Test Python imports after major file edits
- Use proper multi-line comments or docstrings for reference code
- Consider moving old code to separate documentation files instead of leaving in source
