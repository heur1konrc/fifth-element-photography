# Wizard Current Status - Oct 22, 2025

## What's Working ✅

### Victory #1: Order Form Displays Products
- After 15+ hours battling Railway Python cache, created NEW route `/print-order` that bypasses all cached code
- All 1,420 products now loading from database
- Retail prices calculated: `cost_price × 1.50` (50% markup for testing)
- Products organized by category

### Victory #2: Wizard Interface Created
- Multi-step wizard at `/print-order-wizard`
- Step 1: Product Type selection (8 types as cards)
- Product types in correct logical order
- Clean, professional UI with progress indicator

### Victory #3: Step 3 Uses Dropdown
- Size selection uses dropdown instead of cards
- Format: "12×16 - $35.99"
- Much more compact and scannable

## Current Challenge ⚠️

### Step 2 Options Display

**What works:**
- Framed Canvas Prints: Shows depth + color combinations as cards (e.g., "0.75" - Black")
- Currently using cascading dropdowns (just deployed)

**What needs improvement:**
- Framed Fine Art Paper Prints has 790 combinations (Paper × Mat × Color)
- Current dropdown approach shows truncated text
- User wants CARDS for browsing, not dropdowns

**Desired flow for Framed Fine Art:**
1. Step 2: Paper Type (cards) → Next
2. Step 3: Mat Size (cards) → Next  
3. Step 4: Frame Color (cards) → Next
4. Step 5: Size (dropdown)

This requires **dynamic step count** (5 steps for Framed Fine Art vs 3-4 for other products).

## Next Steps Options

### Option A: Full Multi-Step Wizard (Complex)
- Implement dynamic step count based on product type
- Separate step for each option level
- All options as cards, only size as dropdown
- **Effort:** High (significant restructuring)

### Option B: Simpler Interim Solution
- Keep 4-step structure
- Show all combinations as cards in Step 2
- Add organization: collapsible sections, pagination, or search
- **Effort:** Medium

### Option C: Revert and Iterate
- Revert Step 2 to simple card display
- Accept the "garbled mess" temporarily
- Focus on other priorities (pricing tool integration)
- **Effort:** Low

## Technical Notes

### Data Structure
Products have all necessary data:
- `print_sku`: Product SKU (e.g., "101001")
- `lumaprints_options`: Option IDs (e.g., "1,16" or '{"mat_size": 64, "paper_type": 74}')
- `name`: Full product name with all options
- `cost_price`, `retail_price`, `size`

### Parser Functions
- `parseFramedCanvas()`: Extracts frame depth and color
- `parseFramedFineArt()`: Extracts paper type, mat size, and frame color
- Both work correctly when tested
