## Technical Notes

### Domain Configuration
- Railway app serves both domains:
  - `fifth-element-photography-production.up.railway.app`
  - `fifthelement.photos` (custom domain)
- All customer-facing URLs use `fifthelement.photos`

### Image URL Handling
- Gallery images stored at: `https://fifthelement.photos/images/`
- Image URL passed via query parameter
- Wizard validates and loads image dimensions

### Product Filtering
- Framed Fine Art limited to:
  - Paper: Hot Press, Cold Press, Semi-Gloss, Semi-Matte
  - Mat: No Mat only
  - Frame Color: Black, White
- Reduces 790 options to ~256 manageable options

## Files Modified

1. `/templates/index.html`
   - Line 344: Button onclick and text

2. `/static/js/script.js`
   - Lines 650-661: New `openOrderWizard()` function

## Testing Status
- ✅ Button text updated
- ✅ Button links to wizard
- ✅ Image URL passed correctly
- ✅ Domain stays as fifthelement.photos
- ⏳ Awaiting user confirmation of complete flow

## Next Steps
1. User testing of gallery → wizard flow
2. Pricing tool integration
3. Shopping cart enhancements
4. Checkout flow completion
