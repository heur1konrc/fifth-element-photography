## Critical Lessons Learned

### Aspect Ratio Requirements

- **Solution:** Use square formats (12x12) or match ratios exactly
- **3:2 images:** Use 12x8 canvas, NOT 8x12
- **Square images:** Use 12x12 canvas

### OrderDesk Configuration
- **Store ID:** 125137
- **API Endpoint:** https://app.orderdesk.me/api/v2/orders
- **Headers Required:** ORDERDESK-STORE-ID, ORDERDESK-API-KEY
- **Metadata Format:** print_url, print_width, print_height, print_sku, lumaprints_options

## Deployment Process
1. Make changes to local files
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m "description"`
4. `git push origin main`
5. Railway auto-deploys (usually 1-2 minutes)
