- `test_orderdesk_route.py`: Standalone test route (backup)

## Current Test Configuration
- **Product:** Canvas Print 0.75" (12x12)
- **Test Image:** https://fifthelement.photos/images/12x12_Sparrow.jpg
- **Dimensions:** 12x12 (1:1 aspect ratio - perfect for Lumaprints)
- **Test Price:** $0.01 (hardcoded for testing)
- **Lumaprints Options:** "1,5"
- **PayPal:** Fully integrated with payment verification

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NEXT STEPS - PRICING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Admin Pricing Interface
**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:** 
- Lumaprints API has NO pricing endpoint
- All pricing must be manually configured
- Current system uses hardcoded $0.01 test amount
- Need dynamic pricing with markup/margin control

**REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Admin Interface for Pricing Management**
   - Add/remove product sizes for each type (Canvas, Metal, Fine Art Paper)
   - Set base cost for each size/product combination
   - Configure markup/margin percentage (adjustable)
   - Real-time price calculation preview

2. **Dynamic Pricing System**
   - Replace hardcoded $0.01 with calculated prices
   - Formula: (Base Cost + Shipping) Ã— (1 + Markup%)
   - Update PayPal amount dynamically when customer changes products
   - Store pricing data in JSON files or database

3. **Product Configuration**
   - Canvas Print sizes and costs
   - Metal Print sizes and costs  
   - Fine Art Paper sizes and costs
   - Shipping cost calculations

### Current Admin Issue
- Admin interface showing problems (screenshot needed)
- Need to fix admin before implementing pricing management

## What's Next (In Priority Order)

### Phase 1: URGENT - Pricing Management System
1. **Fix current admin interface issues**
2. **Create pricing management section in admin**
   - Product type management (Canvas, Metal, Paper)
   - Size management for each product type
   - Cost entry for each size
   - Markup percentage configuration
3. **Implement dynamic pricing calculations**
   - Replace hardcoded $0.01 test amount
   - Update PayPal integration for dynamic amounts
   - Real-time price updates in order form

### Phase 2: Gallery Integration
1. Add "Order Print" buttons to gallery modals
2. Integrate pricing calculator JavaScript
3. Connect gallery images to order form
4. Handle different aspect ratios automatically

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Order confirmation emails
2. Customer order tracking
3. Order management in admin panel
4. Inventory tracking

## Critical Lessons Learned

### PayPal Integration
- **Smart Payment Buttons:** Use PayPal SDK with client ID
- **Pay Later Disabled:** Add `disable-funding=paylater` to SDK URL
- **Payment Verification:** Check paypal_order_id and paypal_payer_id before order submission
- **Dynamic Amounts:** PayPal amount must be updated when customer changes products

### Pricing Management Requirements
- **No API Pricing:** Lumaprints provides no pricing endpoint
- **Manual Configuration:** All costs must be entered manually
- **Admin Control:** Business owner needs ability to adjust margins
- **Dynamic Updates:** Prices must update in real-time based on product selection

### Aspect Ratio Requirements
- **Lumaprints Rule:** Only 1% difference allowed between image and canvas aspect ratios
- **Solution:** Use square formats (12x12) or match ratios exactly
- **3:2 images:** Use 12x8 canvas, NOT 8x12
- **Square images:** Use 12x12 canvas

### OrderDesk Configuration
- **Store ID:** 125137
- **API Endpoint:** https://app.orderdesk.me/api/v2/orders
- **Headers Required:** ORDERDESK-STORE-ID, ORDERDESK-API-KEY
- **Metadata Format:** print_url, print_width, print_height, print_sku, lumaprints_options
- **Payment Info:** paypal_order_id, paypal_payer_id, payment_status

## Deployment Process

### Safe Staging Workflow (RECOMMENDED)
1. Work on `Staging` branch (capital S)
2. Make changes to local files
3. `git add .`
4. `git commit -m "description"`
5. `git push origin Staging`
6. Railway staging deploys automatically
7. Test on staging URL
8. When ready: `git checkout main && git merge Staging && git push origin main`
9. Live site auto-deploys

### Direct to Live (Emergency Only)
1. `git checkout main`
2. Make changes
3. `git add . && git commit -m "description" && git push origin main`
4. Test at fifthelement.photos
